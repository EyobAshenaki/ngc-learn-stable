# Lecture 4D: Short-Term Plasticity

In this lesson, we will study how short-term plasticity (STDP) dynamics 
using one of ngc-learn's in-built synapses, the `STPDenseSynapse`. 
Specifically, we will study how a dynamic synapse may be constructed and 
examine what short-term depression (STD) and short-term facilitation dominated 
configurations of an STP synapse look like.
